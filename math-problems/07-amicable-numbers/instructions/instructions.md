### Objective

Write a program that prints the list of all pairs of amicable numbers smaller than 1,000,000. 

Two numbers are said to be amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of one number is equal to that of the other number. The proper divisors of a number are the positive prime factors of the number other than the number itself. Amicable numbers should not be confused with friendly numbers. 

For instance, the number 220 has the proper divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110, whose sum is 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142; their sum is 220. Therefore, the numbers 220 and 284 are said to be amicable.
