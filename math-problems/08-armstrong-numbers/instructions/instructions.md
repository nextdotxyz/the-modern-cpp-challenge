### Objective

Write a program that prints all Armstrong numbers with three digits.

An Armstrong number (named so after Michael F. Armstrong), also called a narcissistic number, a pluperfect digital invariant, or a plus perfect number, is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits when they are raised to the power of the number of digits. As an example, the smallest Armstrong number is 153, which is equal to `1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3`.
