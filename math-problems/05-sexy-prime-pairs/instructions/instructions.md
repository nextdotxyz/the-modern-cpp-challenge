### Objective

Write a program that prints all the sexy prime pairs up to a limit entered by the user.

Sexy prime numbers are prime numbers that differ from each other by six (for example 5 and 11, or 13 and 19). There are also **twin primes**, which differ by two, and **cousin primes**, which differ by four.

### Implementation

In the previous challenge, we implemented a function that determines whether an integer is a prime number. We will reuse that function for this exercise. What you have to do is check that if a number n is prime, the number n+6 is also prime, and in this case print the pair to the console.
