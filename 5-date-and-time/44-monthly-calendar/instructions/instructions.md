# Objective

Write a function that prints up to 10 rows of Pascal's triangle to the console.

# Implementation

Pascal's triangle is a construction representing  binomial coefficients. The triangle starts with a row that has a single  value of 1. Elements of each row are constructed by summing the numbers above, to the left and right, and treating blank entries as 0. Here is an example of the triangle with five rows:



```markup
        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1
```
