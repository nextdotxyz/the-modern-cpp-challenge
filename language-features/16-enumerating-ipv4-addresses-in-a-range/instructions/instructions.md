### Objective

Write a program that allows the user to input two IPv4 addresses representing a range and list all the addresses in that range.

### Implementation

Extend the structure defined for the previous problem to implement the requested functionality.

To be able to enumerate IPv4 addresses in a given range, it should first be possible to compare IPv4 values. Therefore, we should implement at least operator `<`, but the following listing contains implementation for all comparison operators: 
1. `==` 
2. `!=` 
3. `<` 
4. `>` 
5. `<=` 
6. `>=` 

Also, in order to increment an IPv4 value, implementations for both the prefix and postfix operator`++` are provided.
